            Design has been a part of my life ever since I could remember. My
            grandfather was an illustrator for academic research books and my
            mother was a painter but she didn't have a typical canvas frame to
            work on. She painted on clothes and created scenes of tropical
            botany and aves(a.k.a avian dinosaurs, a.k.a birds). Her work was
            bursting with color, texture, and light. I adored her work and
            proudly wore the masterpieces.

            As a kid, my bedroom was scattered with paint brushes, coloring
            pencils, and charcoal. In fact, I can't recall a time in my life
            when I did not have an easel to create beautiful things on. As I got
            older, I also dabbed in jewelry making and fashion design. However,
            my interest wasn't just limited to conventional design. I was
            attracted to anything that could be made beautiful-plating food for
            our large family dinners for instance.
